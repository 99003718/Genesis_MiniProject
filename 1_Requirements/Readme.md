# Requirements
**Introduction**

Since the inception of the educated class, we needed to assess the people based on their technical ability to bring the best in their respective fields but as the number of people needed to assess grew more it became tough analyse them all, this is when automated tools came up to give us the idea of results, crunching time needed to minutes, which used to take months to compute the data.

**Research**

After, the Industrial Revolution there was a need to educate, train people in the field of engineering to meet the demands of products but there was no way to judge people from their abilities, this is when the art of assessing people came up. Today almost every online exam that are being conducted by any recruiting institutions or companies use online tools to assess the people.

**Cost and Features**

Our software can calculate the performance of a student by comparing his marks with the class average in each learning objective, co-relate the marks of the student between pre-survey and post-survey, calculate the class maxima in each learning objective and class minima , and graphically displays the data.

In the market the cost for this feature may from few thousands to lakhs depending on the type of feature being used, and number of students being used to assess.
## Defining Our System

- It is a tool that analyse performance of a student in a particular module and also in subject.
- It is need of an hour to make a student realise where he stands in overall class and at what part of subject he should focus.
- When a faculty try to do job of capturing the data of a student for tests and surveys then it will take longer time compared to this tool. It is a useful tool for students as well as faculty.

**SWOT Analysis :**

1. **Strength :** It can track performance of a individual student that too module wise. Gives a report which analyse student&#39;s performance with the overall class. It becomes easy for faculty to find out progress of students and on which part he needs to focus **.**
2. **Weakness :** Have to feed data of students&#39; performance in different surveys and tests.
3. **Opportunity :** By looking at the report, student can self review his performance and can improve those parts in which he is excelling. Teachers can monitor learnings of students.
4. **Threats :** Duplicate entries can be a threat and handling those is difficult.

**4 W&#39;s &amp; 1 H :**

1. **What :**

- It is a measure of students&#39; performance in particular module and overall subject.
- It is a tool for faculty to analyse performance of class.

1. **When :**

- Whenever any kind of survey or test is over this tool can be efficiently used.

1. **Why :**

- Makes easy to track progress of the student
- It becomes easy for faculty to find out progress of students and on which part he needs to focus **.**

1. **Where :**

- Student can see report of his progress in each module in format of spider chart which can be also accessed through a report sent on mail.

1. **How :**

- The process also helps students internalize knowledge, turning what and how they learn into a well of resources they can use in the future. When students assess their own work, when they identify their own strengths and weaknesses, the likelihood that they will do better next time is greater.
